 * Steps `data-beat` on `el` through 0..3 on a single timer while `enabled`, and removes it otherwise.
 * The pulse ring and the agent and plan-step blinks in fleet.css read it. Each CSS animation that repeats
 * forever steps at its own phase, so a page with many of them changes on almost every display refresh.
 * One shared beat changes them all at once, a few times a second. It is set on the element directly, so
 * a beat never re-renders React. It stays still under prefers-reduced-motion.
 * It runs while the tab is hidden on purpose (#1054): it is not a poll, it makes no request and only sets an attribute,
 * and a browser already slows a hidden tab's timers to about one a second.
