// A viewer watching an agent's panel takes a lease by fetching GET /sessions/:id/agents/:agentId/activity, and
// renews it with every fetch. The reply to each mod report lists the loops under a live lease (`watch`); the mod
// captures and sends a loop's entries only while it is listed. The server keeps the last 20 entries of a watched
// loop and drops them when the lease lapses, when the session leaves the live set or is deleted, and on restart.
// Entries from before the lease began are never kept, so a viewer who comes back starts empty.
//
// The Admin can turn the whole feature off (Admin > Settings > Feature flags, `activity-feed`). While it is off no lease
// is granted, nothing is listed as watched and nothing a mod sends is kept; the fleet calls `clear()` when it goes off.
