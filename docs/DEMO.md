# Demo script

This page is for anyone showing Podium to other people. It is a script built to be screen-recorded, in
three parts: setup, a prompt to paste into a live Claude Code session, and a simulated fleet for the "many
sessions" shot. Everything the demo prompt does is read-only, so it is safe to run in this repo or any other.

Do one dry run before you record, and fix the wording of the prompt if Claude takes a different route than the script
expects.

## What the demo shows

1. A session shows up in the browser within about two seconds of its first prompt, with no refresh.
2. The plan Claude writes appears as steps, and the steps tick off as the work finishes.
3. Agents Claude launches appear as rows with their model, effort, status, tokens and cost.
4. A failed call is captured with the command, the exit code and the last lines of output.
5. A second, third and fourth session join the same wall (simulated), including ones that go silent and ones
   whose context window fills.
6. When the sessions end, they leave on their own.

Podium watches. It never types into a terminal, and the only thing it can send is an answer to a session that is waiting on its person, which is off unless the Admin and the session's owner turn it on. That is worth saying out loud.

## Before you record

Use two terminals and one browser window. Keep the browser and the Claude terminal side by side so the
viewer sees both at once.

1. Install and start the server (Node 24 and npm):

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   The API is on http://127.0.0.1:4317 and the UI is on http://localhost:5173/#/.

   To show the production-style service instead, use `podiumctl start` and open
   http://127.0.0.1:4317/#/. If the server has a token (`podiumctl token` prints it), set the same value in
   the mod's `token` option.

2. Open http://localhost:5173/#/ in the browser. With nothing reporting, the wall explains how to start a
   session. That empty state is a good first shot.

3. Pick the theme you want from the Theme dropdown in the row under the top bar and size the window before
   you start recording. Layout changes mid-take are distracting.

4. In the second terminal, start Claude Code with the mod installed. Install it once from the
   marketplace (`/plugin marketplace add eengelking/skills`, then
   `/plugin install podium-reporter@eengelking-marketplace`), or load it from a checkout for this session:

   ```sh
   claude --plugin-dir /path/to/podium/mod/podium-reporter
   ```

   Both ways are in [REPORTER.md](REPORTER.md#install-the-mod).

   The session appears on the wall once you send it a prompt, not before. Until then the status line under
   the prompt reads `podium vX.Y.Z ● 0 live`. After the first prompt it reads `podium vX.Y.Z ● 1 live`.

5. Type `/podium` to show the link, connection state and report counts. Then give the session a readable
   name, because the wall shows it on the card:

   ```
   /podium name demo-orchestrator
   ```

6. Optional: set `explainFailures` to `true` in the mod options before the take if you want a short Haiku
   explanation under the failed agent. It costs a little and is off by default.

## Beat 1: the live session (the prompt)

Paste this into the Claude session. The agent descriptions are written to match the plan step titles word
for word on purpose. Podium links an agent to a plan step by matching the text, and a loose match leaves the
owner column empty.

````text
This is a live demo of a fleet dashboard that is watching this session. Please do exactly the
following, and keep your own commentary short.

1. Create a plan with these five steps using TaskCreate, in this order. Use these exact titles.
   - Map the server routes
   - Map the reporter hooks
   - Map the frontend views
   - Check a path that does not exist
   - Write the summary

2. Mark "Map the server routes" in progress, then launch three Explore agents in parallel, in one
   message, so they run at the same time. Give each agent the exact description shown, and use the
   cheapest model with low effort for each.
   - description "Map the server routes": list the HTTP routes under server/src/fleet and what each does.
   - description "Map the reporter hooks": list the hooks in mod/podium-reporter/hooks and what each
     one reports.
   - description "Map the frontend views": list the views and main components under
     frontend/src/fleet.
   Each agent should answer in under 120 words. They are read-only. They must not edit anything.

3. As each agent returns, mark its matching step completed with TaskUpdate.

4. Launch one more Explore agent with the exact description "Check a path that does not exist". Its
   only job is to run `ls /tmp/podium-demo-this-path-does-not-exist` and report what happened. The
   command is supposed to fail. That failure is the point of this step.

5. Mark that step completed, mark "Write the summary" in progress, and write a six-line summary of how
   Podium is put together from what the agents found. Then mark the last step completed.

Do not edit any files, do not commit, and do not run anything other than reading files and the one
failing `ls`.

### What to point at while it runs

| When | Where to look | What to say |
|---|---|---|
| Plan appears | The plan panel on the session | "Claude wrote a five-step plan. This is read from its task list, not typed by hand." |
| Three agents launch | The agent tree under the session | "Three agents in parallel. Each shows its model, effort, status and token count as it works." |
| Agents finish | Plan steps and agent rows | "The step is linked to the agent that owns it, and the cost rolls up to the session." |
| The `ls` fails | The failure box on that agent | "Failed calls are captured with the command, the exit code and the last lines of output, with anything that looks like a secret removed." |
| Summary written | The session card and the facts bar | "Context fill, cost and the git branch are all live. The orchestrator's cost is the session ledger. The agent figures are estimates, and the UI labels them that way." |

Click the session card to open the focused view if you want a closer look at one session. Click an agent
row to open its detail panel.

## Beat 2: a whole fleet (the simulator)

One real session looks tidy. The point of Podium is many at once. With the dev server still running, open a
third terminal and start the simulator while the recording is going:

```sh
npm run podium:sim -- --sessions 5 --chaos
```

Add `--token "$(podiumctl token)"` if the server has a token.

The simulator posts realistic reports for five fake sessions, so the wall fills up next to your real one.
`--chaos` makes some of them go silent (they turn stale), fail more often and overflow their context
windows. Those are the three situations that are hard to produce on cue with a real session.

Two more flags: `--seed` gives you the same run twice, and `--speed 2` makes it move faster.

Things to show while it runs:

- A stale session. Say how long a session can be silent before it shows as stale, then let it drop off.
- A context blowout. The window fill and the blowout count are on the session card and in the focused view.
- Several failures. Open one and show the failure record.
- The sort controls on the agent table. Click a column header, and click it again to reverse it.

Stop the simulator with Ctrl-C. It ends every session it started, and they leave the wall a few seconds
later with no refresh. That is the last shot of this beat.

## Beat 3: sessions that never loaded the mod (optional)

This makes the point that you do not have to restart anything.

1. Add the settings hooks from "Sessions without the mod" in
   [REPORTER.md](REPORTER.md#sessions-without-the-mod) to `~/.claude/settings.json`.
2. Start a plain `claude` session in another terminal and send a prompt.
3. It shows up marked "settings hooks" with the session, directory, model and agents, and with the context,
   cost and plan left empty.
4. Remove the hooks afterwards if you do not want them on permanently.

## Beat 4: history (optional)

`#/history` lists the sessions that ended on a chosen day. Open one to see its agent detail from stored
rows. This works after a server restart too, because everything is in SQLite.

To show that nothing is lost, run `podiumctl restart` (or stop and start `npm run dev`) with a session live.
The session comes back as stale and recovers as soon as its reporter sends again.

## Known rough edges, so they do not surprise you on camera

These come from the known issues in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

- Elapsed times and the stale countdown pause when the browser tab is in the background. Keep the window
  visible while recording.
- A plan step shows no owner if the agent description does not match the step title. The prompt above is
  written to avoid that. If you edit it, keep the two in sync.
- An idle interactive session counts as "waiting on you", so a session sitting at the prompt shows a waiting
  callout. That is correct, but it can look like an error.
- The status line and a few interactive paths have only been exercised in tests and headless runs, not in a
  long interactive session. Do the dry run.
- Cost for agents is an estimate from token counts and a price table. Do not call it a bill.

## Clean up after the take

- Stop the simulator (Ctrl-C) and confirm its sessions have left the wall.
- Type `/exit` in the Claude session and confirm it leaves too.
- Stop the server (`Ctrl-C` on `npm run dev`, or `podiumctl stop`).
- If you added the settings hooks for Beat 3, remove them from `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- `git status` should show nothing changed. The demo prompt reads files and runs one failing `ls`.
